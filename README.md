Afilmory (/əˈfɪlməri/, "uh-FIL-muh-ree") is a term created for personal photography websites, blending Auto Focus (AF), aperture (light control), film (vintage medium), and memory (captured moments).

A modern photo gallery website built with React + TypeScript, supporting automatic photo synchronization from multiple storage sources (S3, GitHub), featuring high-performance WebGL rendering, masonry layout, EXIF information display, thumbnail generation, and more.

## 🛠️ Self-Host (Advanced)

If you prefer to host Afilmory yourself, you can deploy it on your own infrastructure. This requires more technical knowledge and ongoing maintenance.

> **💡 Tip**: For most users, we recommend using the [official SaaS](https://afilmory.art/) instead. Self-hosting is best suited for developers who need full control over their deployment or have specific infrastructure requirements.

### Option A: Docker (recommended)

[Docker deployment guide](https://github.com/Afilmory/docker) ships prebuilt images with minimal setup.

### Option B: Manual install

1. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill in your site name, description, and social links.
2. Prepare access to your photo storage (S3/B2/GitHub/local). The builder will read photos and generate thumbnails plus `photos-manifest.json`.
3. Run the builder to generate assets, then start the site.

Looking for developer commands, environment variables, and builder config details? See `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

For detailed self-hosting instructions, see the [Documentation](https://docs.afilmory.art).

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Storage Provider

Implement the `StorageProvider` interface to support new storage backends:

```typescript
import { StorageProvider } from './src/core/storage/interfaces'

class MyStorageProvider implements StorageProvider {
  async getFile(key: string): Promise<Buffer | null> {
    // Implement file retrieval logic
  }

  async listImages(): Promise<StorageObject[]> {
    // Implement image list retrieval logic
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

### Custom Image Processing

Add custom processors in the `src/core/image/` directory:

```typescript
export async function customImageProcessor(buffer: Buffer) {
  // Custom image processing logic
  return processedBuffer
}
```
